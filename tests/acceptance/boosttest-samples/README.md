This contains examples from the `libs\test\example` directory in the boost 
distribution.

Changes:

* Make tests compile in "single header" mode by including the 
  `<boost/test/included/unit_test.hpp>` header.
* Excluded `unit_test_example_12.cpp`, as this test required user input using
  the terminal.
